## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the program:

- Python 3.8+ installed (if running from source).
- TkinterDnD2 and ttkbootstrap installed as dependencies

### Installation

#### **Run as Executable (Recommended)**

1.  Download the latest release from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/chandrath/Simple-Code-Combiner/releases).
2.  Run the **`CodeCombiner.exe`** file.

#### **Run from Source**

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chandrath/Simple-Code-Combiner.git
    cd Simple-Code-Combiner
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install tkinterdnd2 ttkbootstrap
    ```
3.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

### Drag and Drop:

- Drag and drop code files directly into the text area of the application.

### Manage Extensions:

- Use the `Preferences -> Manage Extensions` to view the current list of supported file types.
- Add a new file extension (e.g., `.myext`) into the text entry and click `Add`
- Select an extension in the list and click `Remove` to remove it from the list.

### Combine:

- Click the 'Combine Files' button to merge the content of all listed files into a single output in the text area.

### Copy and Save:

- Click the 'Copy to Clipboard' button to copy the combined content to the clipboard.
- Use the 'File -> Save Combined File' option to save the combined content to a file.

## Building from Source with PyInstaller

To create a standalone executable for the `CodeCombiner` application (which uses `tkinterdnd2` for drag-and-drop functionality), follow these instructions. It is crucial to complete each step carefully for a successful build.

**Prerequisites:**

1.  **Python and Pip:** Ensure you have Python (version 3.8 or higher) and `pip` installed on your system.
2.  **PyInstaller:** If you don't have it installed, install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```

3.  **`tkinterdnd2`:** Ensure you have `tkinterdnd2` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install tkinterdnd2
    ```

**Steps:**

1.  **Prepare Project Files:** Ensure your main project file (`main.py`) and the hook file (`hook-tkinterdnd2.py`) are in the **same directory**.
2.  **Obtain `hook-tkinterdnd2.py`:** Download `hook-tkinterdnd2.py` and save it in the same directory as your `main.py` file. The original file (under MIT License) can be obtained from:

```
 https://github.com/pmgagne/tkinterdnd2/blob/master/hook-tkinterdnd2.py
```

    *Note: If you are working with an updated version or fork, make sure to use the corresponding hook file (if needed).*

_A modified version of the hook file that resolves certain issues can be used from the project folder_ 3. **Build with PyInstaller:** Open a terminal or command prompt in the same directory where your project files are located. Then, execute the following PyInstaller command:

    ```bash
    pyinstaller -F --additional-hooks-dir=. --onefile --windowed CodeCombiner.py
    ```
    *   **`-F` or `--onefile`**: Creates a single, self-contained executable file.
    *   **`--additional-hooks-dir=.`**: Tells PyInstaller to use the `hook-tkinterdnd2.py` file in the current directory to correctly include `tkinterdnd2` files.
    *   **`--windowed`**: Creates an executable without a console window, suitable for GUI applications.
    *   **`CodeCombiner.py`**: Specifies your main Python script file.

4.  **Locate the Executable:** After a successful build, the executable file will be located in the `dist` subdirectory within your project directory.

**Explanation of the Process**

- **`tkinterdnd2` Dependency:** The `tkinterdnd2` library is a wrapper for the `tkdnd` extension and requires special handling during PyInstaller builds. The `hook-tkinterdnd2.py` file provides PyInstaller with the necessary information to correctly bundle `tkdnd`.
- **Custom Hook File:** The custom hook file ensures that all platform specific binaries of `tkdnd` library are included in your build. The `additional-hooks-dir=.` tells PyInstaller where to find the custom hook script.
- **One-File Distribution:** Using `-F` or `--onefile` provides a single executable, which simplifies distribution as it does not require additional files or setup on the user's machine.
- **No Console Window:** By using the `--windowed` the end user won't see a console window when launching the executable.

**Important Notes:**

- **License:** The provided `hook-tkinterdnd2.py` file is under the MIT License. Make sure you retain the license notices where appropriate.
- **Error Troubleshooting:** If you encounter errors during the build, carefully check the terminal output and verify that you have followed all the steps.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test your built executable after building it to make sure all functions work as expected.
- **Alternative Hook File:** If the hook file from the repository does not work properly, use the modified one from project directory.
